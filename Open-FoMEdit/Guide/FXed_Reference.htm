<A NAME="fxed"><h1>FxED</h1></A>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:16.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<h2><a name="overview"></a>Overview</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>This document details the new system for creating special
effects for The Operative 2.  It covers how to use the FxED application to
create a group of FX and details the properties of each individual FX.  I will
go over some common uses for each FX and which FX should be used to create a
specific special effect.  This paper is intended as a reference tool for anyone
with a creative mind who would like to create some cool looking special effects
but all are welcome to read and comment on its contents.  As changes are made
to FxED, the individual FX and the system as a whole this document will be
updated to reflect any changes or additions.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Creating special effects for previous games meant having an
engineer and an artist sit down together to create and FX in code and then
expose a few properties for tweaking in a text file.   This severely limited
the types of special effects we could have and limited the behavior of the FX
we did have.  For TO2 we decided to use the FxED application to create and edit
all of our special effects.  With FxED you can specify the length of a whole
group of FX, the length of an individual FX, the scale, color and alpha at any
point in time for an individual FX and you can even create a motion path for
each individual FX to follow without setting up lots of key framers in DEdit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><a name="general"></a>General</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>You will see the word FX and GroupFX used in this document. 
FX refers to the individual objects that are considered special effects.  A FX
can be a ParticleSystemFX, SpriteFX, or even a NullFX.  A GroupFX are a
collection of FX.  A GroupFX may contain one or many FX.  When working with FxED
you are creating GroupFX by adding FX to them.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each FX has a set of properties that you can edit.  Some of
these properties are common between all the FX but most are specific to the
individual FX.  I will explain how to use each property of each FX later on.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><a name="getting_started"></a>Getting Started</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>FxED is the application used to create the GroupFX that will
be used in the game.  When FxED runs for the first time on your computer you
will have to fill out a dialog box of information telling FxED where to look
for resources and the file containing the FX.  If you wish to run the game from
within FxED you will need to edit the “App to execute…” to be the full path
name of your Lithtech.exe file.  You can also enter in optional information
into the command line if you wish to run the game in a window or load a
specific level.  You must fill out the “Location of resource file…” box.  This
tells FxED where to look for the resources such as .ltb’s and .spr’s, this
should be the full path of your Game directory.  The “Location and name of clientfx.fxd…”
box also needs to be filled out in order to get the list of FX you can use. 
This should be the full path form the “Location of resource file…” box with “\clientfx.fxd”
added to the end.  FxED is now ready for you to work with and will never ask
you for this information again.  If you made a mistake in entering in the info
or would like to change some options for the command line you can do so by
selecting “Edit Game Info” form the File menu.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>You will now want to open the file that contains all the GroupFX
for the game.  Click on the open icon and open the clientfx.fxf file found on
the ClientFX directory of your Game directory.  You will now have a list of GroupFX
that you can open and edit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="creating_a_groupfx"></a>Creating A GroupFX</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>To create a new GroupFX simply click on the “new” icon and a
blank GroupFX will appear.  By default all GroupFX start off with a Phase
Length of 10000.  Phase Length is the lifetime of the GroupFX in milliseconds
so each GroupFX is 10 seconds long by default.  To change this, just click on
the button that says 10000 and enter in a new time.  To start adding FX to this
GroupFX you will first need to add a Track.  Tracks are holders for Keys.  Keys
are the specific individual FX.  Each Key needs to be placed on a Track, you
can have multiple Keys per Track or you can have each Track contain only one
Key.  Once you have added a Track by right clicking in the gray area of the GroupFX
and selecting Add Track you will need to add a Key.  Right click on an empty
space in a Track and select Add Key, a popup box will appear with a list of FX
you can add for this Key.  Select the type of FX you would like to add and it
will then appear on your Track.  You can now move this Key around your Track so
you can set when you would like this FX to begin playing.  You can also
lengthen the FX by grabbing its edges and growing or shrinking the Key to the
desired length.  To have the FX play for the whole duration of the GroupFX
right click on the Key and select Expand Key from the menu.  If you have many
FX that are of the same type you may want to differentiate them from each other
by giving them each a unique name.  To do this right click on the key and
select “Name Key” from the popup menu and enter in a custom name for this Key.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Now that you have your Key set to the desired length and
start time you can edit the properties of the FX by right clicking on the Key
and selecting Edit Key.  A popup dialog box appears with several different
properties listed for you to edit.  From the same right click menu you can
select options to edit the scale of the FX, the color of the FX and create
motion for the FX.  Not all FX types expose the ability to edit all of these
options.  A list of FX and properties that you can edit are listed below.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><a name="color_keys"></a>Color Keys</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>For FX that allow you to create and edit color keys you
access this interface by right clicking on a Key in the GroupFX and select
“Edit Color Keys” from the menu.  This will bring up a dialog box with a large
colored bar numbered from 0 to the lifetime of the Key.  The full time of the
FX is represented in the bar along the bottom the, the alpha of the FX at a
particular time is represented on the left side.  From here you can create new
color keys or edit the two preexisting keys.  There are always at least two
color keys per FX, one for the very beginning of the FX and one for the end of
the FX.  By default these two keys are set to the color white and are fully
opaque.   To create a new key, simply click in the color bar at the time you
wish the new key to be and at the alpha you want the new key to be.  You are
then prompted to choose a color for the key.  After a key is created you can
move it around to the time and alpha desired by left clicking the key dragging
it to the desired values.  You can change the color of a color key by right
clicking on one and choosing a color from the color menu.  To delete a key
simply select it by left clicking and then click the Delete Key button.  You
cannot delete the two preexisting beginning and end keys.  If you create a set
of color keys that you wish to use for other FX you can save them by clicking
on the “Add To Favorites” button, you can select from a list of favorite color
keys by selecting the choose button. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><a name="_Motion_Keys"></a><a name="_Motion_Keys_(Top"></a><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><a name="scale_keys"></a>Scale Keys</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>For FX that allow you to create and edit scale keys you
access this interface by right clicking on a Key in the GroupFX and select
“Edit Scale Keys” from the menu.   This will bring up a dialog box with a large
white bar numbered from 0 to the lifetime of the FX.  The full lifetime of the
FX is represented in the bar at the bottom and the Scale of the FX at a
particular time is represented on the left side, ranging from Min Scale to Max
Scale.  From here you can create new scale keys or edit the two preexisting
keys.  There are always at least two scale keys per FX, one for the very
beginning of the FX and one for the end of the FX.  By default these two keys
are set to a scale of 1.  To change the Min and Max scale for this FX click on
the numbered buttons for Min Scale and Max Scale and then enter a new value. 
To create new scale keys, click in the white bar at the time and scale you
desire, you may move the key to the desired time and scale after creating by
clicking and dragging the key.  To delete a key, right click on it and then
select “delete key” from the menu.  You cannot delete the two preexisting
beginning and end keys.  If you wish to start over again click the “Reset”
button.  This will delete all but the two beginning and end keys and set them
to be at 10% of the Max Scale value.  If you create a set of scale keys that
you wish to use for other FX you can save them by clicking on the “Add To
Favorites” button, you can select from a list of favorite scale keys by
selecting the choose button.  </p>

<h2><a name="fx"></a>FX</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2><a name="particleSystem"></a>ParticleSystem</h2>

<h3><a name="particlesystem_features"></a>Features</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is probably the most used FX in the list.  The particle
system emits individual particles based on the properties that you fill out. 
This FX allows you to edit it’s Color Keys, Scale Keys and Motion Keys.  The
particles are always facing the camera and will never rotate.  You can specify
the particles to use a texture or a sprite.  The Color Keys and Scale Keys for
this FX are per particle, not per system.  This means the particle will
interpolate between its scale and color keys based on its own lifetime.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<A NAME="particlesystem_use"><h3>Use</h3></A>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ParticleSystems can be used almost anywhere for
anything.  They can be used as smoke from a steam pipe, fire, sparks and smoke
form a gun and many other possibilities.  You can set them up to be an impact
FX and emit a puff of smoke when a bullet hits a wall, or as bubbles in the
water.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<A NAME="particlesystem_color_keys"><h3>Color Keys</h3></A>

<p class=MsoNormal>This FX allows you to edit its color keys.  The Color Keys
for a Particle System are per particle.  So every particle will use the color
keys based on their own lifespan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<A NAME="particlesystem_scale_keys"><h3>Scale Keys</h3></A>

<p class=MsoNormal>This FX allows you to edit its Scale Keys.  The Scale Keys
for a Particle System are per particle.  So every particle will use the scale
keys based on their own lifespan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<A NAME="particlesystem_properties"><h3>Properties</h3></A>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<A NAME="particlesystem_updatepos"></A><h4>UpdatePos</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>This property is a drop down list of predefined ways to
update the FX position</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Fixed – This is the most common option and will keep the
     FX at a fixed position.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Follow – If the FX is motion linked to another FX UpdatePos
     must be set to follow</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>PlayerView – If you are using this FX as a MuzzleFlash,
     select PlayerView.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>NodeAttach – If this is selected the FX will attach to the
     specified node.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>SocketAttach - If this is selected the FX will attach to
     the specified socket.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>PV_NodeAttach – This will attach the FX to a node in a PlayerView
     model.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>PV_SocketAttach – This will attach the FX to a socket on a
     PlayerView model.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<A NAME="particlesystem_updateinterval"></A><h4>UpdateInterval</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the length, in seconds, between updates for this
FX.  This is normally set very low so the FX can update every frame.  If
constant updating is not needed then the UpdateInterval should be set higher.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<A NAME="particlesystem_attachname"></A><h4>AttachName</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>If any of the “Attach” options were selected for UpdatePos
this property must be filled out so the FX knows which socket or node to attach
to.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<A NAME="particlesystem_offset"></A><h4>Offset</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the value of this vector property is anything besides
zero the FX will be placed at this position offset from its center.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<A NAME="particlesystem_rotateadd"></A><h4>RotateAdd</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>If the value of this property is anything besides zero the
FX will rotate this amount around the axis every update.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<A NAME="particlesystem_sprite"></A><h4>Sprite</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>The ParticleSystem can use an .spr file as its particles and
each particle will loop through the textures in the sprite.  To select a ,spr
file click the button and browse through the Resource Browser and select the
desired file.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<A NAME="particlesystem_texture"></A><h4>Texture</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>If no Sprite is given, the ParticleSystem can use a single .dtx
as its file for the particles to display. To select a .dtx file click the
button and select the file through the Resource Browser.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<A NAME="particlesystem_emissioninterval"></A><h4>EmissionInterval</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>This controls the length of time, in seconds, between emissions
of the system.  Typically this is set low so the system is constantly emitting
particles, however if you want particle to be emitted in bursts raise the
value. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<A NAME="particlesystem_particlesperemission"></A><h4>ParticlesPerEmission</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Every time the system emits particles, based on the “EmissionInterval”,
it will emit this many particles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<A NAME="particlesystem_gravityacceleration"></A><h4>GravityAcceleration</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>This controls the speed and direction the particles will
float or sink.  A negative value will make the particles sink to the ground and
a positive value will float the particles up towards the sky.  Gravity is
always in relation to the world, no matter what the systems rotation is.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<A NAME="particlesystem_minparticlelifespan"></A><h4>MinParticleLifeSpan</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each particle will last for at least this amount of time, in
seconds.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<A NAME="particlesystem_maxparticlelifespan"></A><h4>MaxParticleLifeSpan</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Each particle will last no longer than this amount of time,
in seconds.  The life span of each particle is a random number between the Min/MaxParticleLifeSpan. 
If you want every particle to last the same amount of time, making these
exactly the same.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<A NAME="particlesystem_minradius"></A><h4>MinRadius</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the minimum distance from the center of the system
that the particles will be emitted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<A NAME="particlesystem_maxradius"></A><h4>MaxRadius</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the maximum distance from the center of the system
that the particles will be emitted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<A NAME="particlesystem_emissionplane"></A><h4>EmissionPlane</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the normal vector of the plane that the particles
are emitted from.  By default this is a plane parallel to the systems Up
vector.  If you are using a ParticleSystem as an impact FX this should be set
to 0.0 0.0 1.0.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<A NAME="particlesystem_minparticlevelocity"></A><h4>MinParticleVelocity</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>This controls the minimum speed and direction that each
particle will have when they are emitted.  The velocity is relative to the
system so if you never want particles to be emitted in the downward direction
of the system, make the Y component positive.  For impact FX the Z component
should be positive so particles never get emitted into the surface they hit.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<A NAME="particlesystem_maxparticlevelocity"></A><h4>MaxParticleVelocity</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>This controls the maximum speed and direction that each
particle will have when they are emitted.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<A NAME="particlesystem_type"></A><h4>Type</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>A dropdown list box of predefined emission types for the
system:</p>

<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Sphere – The particles will emit in all directions around
     the center of the system a distance no less than MinRadius from the center
     and no more than MaxRadius from the center.</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Point -  The particles will emit from the same random
     point on the emission plane at a distance of no less than MinRadius from
     the center and no more than MaxRadius from the center.  If you wish to
     have the particles emit from the direct center of the system make Min/MaxRadius
     0.0</li>
 <li class=MsoNormal>Circle - The particles will emit in a circle on the
     emission plane at a distance of no less than MinRadius from the center and
     no more than MaxRadius From the center.  Playing with Min/MaxRadius can
     yield an emission pattern of a circle, doughnut, or ring.</li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<A NAME="particlesystem_bounce"></A><h4>Bounce</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>If set to Yes, each particle will collide with and bounce
off geometry and solid objects in a realistic manner.  NOTE: This can
dramatically decrease frames and slow the game.  This should be used sparingly
and only with systems that have few active particles.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<A NAME="particlesystem_fliprenderingorder"></A><h4>FlipRenderingOrder</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>By default the newest particle particles are drawn first,
over the older particles in the system.  You can change the order so older
particles are drawn over newer ones by setting this to yes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<A NAME="particlesystem_blendmode"></A><h4>BlendMode</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>Depending on the texture or sprite used you may wish to set
the system to use Additive or Multiply blending.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<A NAME="particlesystem_moveparticleswithsystem"></A><h4>MoveParticlesWithSystem</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal>If a particle system is moving or rotating, the particles
will move and rotate with the system. You can override this behavior by setting
this property to No.  For speed reasons, if a system is staying still (ie. Not
moving or rotating ), keep this value set to Yes.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<A NAME="sprite"></A><h2>Sprite</h2>

<A NAME="sprite_features"></A><h3>Features</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The Sprite FX displays a sprite specified through a .spr
file.  The sprite can rotate, be flat against a wall, or always face the
camera.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This FX allows you to edit its Scale Keys.  The Light’s
scale will change over time by interpolating between the scale keys.  The scale
is in DEdit units so for this FX the scale should be at least 100 to even show
up.  Because changing the scale of a dynamic light forces the engine to
recalculate the lightmaps, it is better to fade a DynaLight in and out using
the intensity scale.  And it looks better to <span style='font-family:Wingdings'>J</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This FX is almost identical to the ParticleSystem FX except
that the Sprites can rotate about there own axis.  The Sprite system emits
individual sprites based on the properties that you fill out.  This FX allows
you to edit it’s Color Keys, Scale Keys and Motion Keys.  The Color Keys and
Scale Keys for this FX are per sprite, not per system.  This means the sprite
will interpolate between its scale and color keys based on its own lifetime.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<a name="spritesystem_use"></a><h3>Use</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>The SpriteSystem can be used almost anywhere that a Particle
system can be used for and more.  The major difference of the Sprite system is
that the individual sprites can rotate which can create a since of movement in
smoke and gas clouds.  Typically ParticleSystems look and better and give
better performance but for things like gas clouds and smoke puffs, adding a
rotation makes all the difference in the world.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Sphere – The sprites will emit in all directions around the
center of the system a distance no less than MinRadius from the center and no
more than MaxRadius from the center.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Point -  The sprites will emit from the same random point on
the emission plane at a distance of no less than MinRadius from the center and
no more than MaxRadius from the center.  If you wish to have the sprites emit
from the direct center of the system make Min/MaxRadius 0.0</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Circle -             The sprites will emit in a circle on
the emission plane at a distance of no less than MinRadius from the center and
no more than MaxRadius From the center.  Playing with Min/MaxRadius can yield
an emission pattern of a circle, doughnut, or ring.</p>

<h2><a name="createfx"></a>CreateFX</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<a name="createfx_features"></a><h3>Features</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>This a unique FX in that it doesn’t render anything or
really do anything but start another premade GroupFX.  You can specify the name
of a GroupFX and whether or not the new FX will loop so you can combine
different GroupFX together quickly and easily.  You have the option to use a
blinding flare by editing the Blind properties.  A blinding flare will disable
the Z and be drawn over everything else if there is a clear path to the camera.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-family:Arial'>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<a name="createfx_use"></a><h3>Use</h3>

<p class=MsoNormal>Whenever you want to start a preexisting GroupFX at a
certain time within another GroupFX you can use this FX to set it up.  The new GroupFX
will begin playing at the time specified by this FX’s Key and will the run
independently of the GroupFX that contains it.  This could mainly be used if
you have an explosion that you want to play and then a looping cloud of smoke
in the middle of the explosion to keep playing after the explosion finishes.</p>
