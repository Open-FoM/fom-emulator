<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>A texture script is a small program
that can be written by engineers in order to create a specific type of effect
on textures. In the old system there were effect such as pan and warble. The scripts
act in a very similar manner, but instead of using the pan effect, you would
use a script, which tells the engine how to pan the texture. Each texture
script has a list of parameters that it allows artists to set in order to
customize behavior for a desired effect, which is again very similar to the old
pan effect where a velocity would specified to control how fast it should
actually pan. Texture scripts are essentially different types of effects that
the engine can use to dynamically update textures and can be controlled through
a set of parameters.</p>

<h3><a name="what_is_a_texture_effect_group">What is a Texture Effect Group?</a></h3>

<span style='mso-bookmark:what_is_a_texture_effect_group'></span>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>The engine itself does not use the
scripts directly. Instead scripts are contained within an object called a
Texture Effect Group. The texture effect group dictates what scripts will be
used, what parameters will be provided to them, and to which texture the script
applies. Each effect group has a unique name as well as a series of stages.
Each stage represents a script and to what it applies. To clarify here is an
example: when rendering a polygon with a detail texture, there are two textures
involved, the base texture and the detail texture. Each one of these textures
can have a script with its own parameters applied, so the base texture could
for example pan, while the detail texture warbled. The settings of the texture
type, script, and parameters are called a stage. This will be clarified further
in the section Creating and Editing Texture Groups. In addition, if you want
one stage to act exactly like a different stage, so that it has the exact same
script and parameters, you can specify that the stage is overridden, and
specify which stage it should copy all the information from. When a stage is
overridden, it does not have any parameters of its own, so changes to the
parameters must be done to the overriding stage.</p>

<h3><a name="assigning_texture_groups_in_dedit">Assigning Texture Groups in
DEdit</a></h3>

<span style='mso-bookmark:assigning_texture_groups_in_dedit'></span>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>Texture groups can be assigned to
brushes in DEdit through the TextureEffect property. Pressing the browse button
on the property causes the Texture Group dialog to appear as shown below:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=474 height=111 id="_x0000_i1025"
src="Images/textureartist002.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>From the dropdown you can select any existing effect groups,
and through the buttons new effect groups can be created or existing ones
edited. Pressing OK will assign the currently selected effect group to all
selected brushes.</p>

<h3><a name="creating_and_editing_texture_groups">Creating and Editing Texture
Groups</a></h3>

<span style='mso-bookmark:creating_and_editing_texture_groups'></span>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'>When a new effect group is created,
or an existing one edited, it brings up the Edit Effect Group dialog shown
below:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><img width=524 height=410 id="_x0000_i1026"
src="Images/textureartist004.jpg"></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>As can be seen, the effect group has a name, which can be
edited when creating a new effect. In addition it has two stages for setting up
how the effect will actually work. First stage one will be examined, which in
the diagram is set up to have a warble effect played on the base texture. The
channel field indicates which texture will have the script applied to it, in
this case it is the Base Texture, but it can also be the Detail Texture,
Environment Map, Light Map, or can also be set to Disabled if this entire stage
should be ignored and nothing effected. The next drop down specifies what stage
overrides this one, and in this case there is nothing overriding it, indicating
that it provides its own script and parameters for controlling the effect. The
script is the actual effect itself, which in the example shows a warble script
selected, which will cause the texture to move around in an odd fashion based
upon the parameters provided. The script name cannot be edited directly, but by
pressing the button to the right it allows the user to select a script through
a file dialog. Once a script is selected, it will be looked at to determine
what parameters it supports. Upon finding those it will display them below the
script allowing the user to enter custom values in order to customize the
script for the particular instance. These parameters are dependant upon the
script itself.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>Stage two
shown below stage one is an example of modifying a different texture channel so
that both can be animating. However, for this one it has been overridden to
copy stage one. This means that it will use the exact same script and
parameters as the first script, and if any of those parameters were to change,
it would change for stage two as well. Essentially overriding allows one stage
to piggyback on a different stage but apply it to a different texture channel.
If this stage was not overridden though, it could provide its own effect and
parameters allowing the detail texture to animate independently of its base texture.</p>

<h3><a name="adding_support_for_triggers">Adding Support for Triggers</a></h3>

<span style='mso-bookmark:adding_support_for_triggers'></span>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Texture scripts can have their parameters changed during
runtime through triggers, allowing such effects as a player walking through a
doorway and causing conveyer belt textures to begin panning or other such
dynamic effects. In order to do this, a TextureFX object must be placed in the
level. The TextureFX has a single property, which should be filled out with the
name of the group that it is corresponding to. This object can then receive
messages of the form:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>SETVAR (&lt;stage&gt; &lt;variable&gt; &lt;value&gt;)<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This will change the effect group’s parameter to the
specified value. Stage represents the stage that is having the parameter change
and can be either 1 or 2. Note that it cannot be a stage that is disabled or a stage
that is overridden. Variable represents the index of the variable that is to be
changed and corresponds to the order in which they are listed in DEdit going
from left to right, top to bottom and must be from one to six. The value is the
value that is to be stored at the specified location. So for example, if we had
a panning script whose parameters were: DirX, DirY, DirZ, Velocity, Offset, and
that was part of the effect group ConveyorBelt.tfg, we would first need to
create a TextureFX object named ConveyorBelt whose parameter TextureEffect was
assigned to ConveyorBelt.tfg so that it would know to modify the conveyor belt
effect group. We could then set up a trigger in a doorway that would start the
conveyor belt up by changing its velocity from 0 to 5. The conveyor belt uses
stage one, and since velocity is the fourth parameter, our message would look
like this:</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>Msg ConveyorBelt SETVAR (1 4 5.0)<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p>
