   57:  # Git Integration (Always-On)
   58:  - Treat git as the default state tracker; run `git status -sb` before/after each work chunk and before reporting completion.
   59:  - Avoid redundant work: check `git log --oneline -n 5` (and open PRs/branches if relevant) before re-implementing.
   60:  - Keep deltas small: stage with `git add -p` or explicit paths; commit at logical checkpoints (<= 1GÇô2 hours) with descriptive
   61:   messages.
   62:  - Update `.gitignore` for generated artifacts (logs/builds) early; never delete user files; use `git rm` only with explicit req
   63:  uest.
   64:  - When a remote exists, push at milestone end; never force-push unless explicitly asked.
   65:  - For risky changes, record the intended delta + rollback command in the working log entry.
