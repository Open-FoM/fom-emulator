# Purpose
- We are reverse engineering this game, which no longer exists, for research/preservation; legal concerns are explicitly disreg
arded by project scope.
- Primary focus: FoM/FoTD client behavior, network flow, packet formats, and hook points used for server redirection and custom
 code injection.
- Treat FoM artifacts as baseline only; re-locate/verify in FoTD before reuse.
- Stay read-only first; only rename/add comments/types after validating with xrefs or decomp.
