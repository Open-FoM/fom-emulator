1226,31226,41226,Mantis Mesothorax,"The rear-most portion of the thoracic region of the Mantis genus of xenomorphs. This part of the xenomorph has the caudal sting attached to it. Although it does not contain any venom, the sting is reinforced with enough precious minerals to allow it to resist damage."
1227,31227,41227,Sticky Xenomorphic Fluid,"The fluid extracted from various xenomorph parts, particularly those that contain fluid-producing glands."
1228,31228,41228,Solid Carbonite Shell,"Extracted from the outermost layer of a xenomorph's carapace, which is primarily made of carbonite which has proven to be very effective as a reinforcing agent."
1229,31229,41229,Xenomorph Proteins,Proteins extracted from the muscle tissues of xenomorphs.
1230,31230,41230,Ultra Resilient Mineral,"Extracted from the claws, spikes, and stings of the various xenomorphs, which are naturally coated with a thin layer of this mineral which gives it its incredible resilience and robustness."
1231,31231,41231,Deuterium Water,"The natural respiratory process of xenomorphs produces heavy water (water with deuterium in place of normal hydrogen molecules), which is then excreted through the intestinal tract."
1232,31232,41232,Xenomorph Hemolymph,"Hemolymph fills the internal cavities of the xenomorphs, acting as both blood and interstitial fluid. The hemolymph is pumped around the body both by the heart and the xenomorph's muscular movements."
1233,31233,41233,Bloody Xenomorph Slime,"As the mantis has a dual circulatory system that utilizes both hemolymph and blood, the two fluids often mix into a bloody mix of what appears to be slime mixed with significant traces of blood."
1234,31234,41234,Xenomorph Endocrine Glands,"The glands of xenomorphs are much sought after for the rare secretions produced that appear to have strong medicinal properties, according to preliminary studies made by biologists on Necars Field."
1235,31235,41235,Plutonium,A transuranic metal capable of being used to create nuclear fission reactions.
1236,31236,41236,Aluminium Alloy,A cheap alloy created using aluminium as a base.
1237,31237,41237,Ceramic,"An inorganic, nonmetallic solid prepared by the action of heat and subsequent cooling."
1238,31238,41238,Artificial Logic Device,An advanced board optimized and developed for the purpose of housing advanced intelligence to manage other systems.
1239,31239,41239,Battery Cell,A simple cell capable of holding a charge for an extended period of time.
